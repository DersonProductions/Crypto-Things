# XDC Network Gasless Subnet Overview

NOTE: This is a generated response to the Whitepaper presented [https://github.com/DersonProductions/Crypto-Things/blob/main/XDC/whitepaper-xdc-gasless-subnet.pdf](https://github.com/DersonProductions/Crypto-Things/blob/main/XDC/whitepaper-xdc-gasless-subnet.pdf) on XDC Gasless Subnets.

## What is the XDC Gasless Subnet?
The XDC gasless subnet is a sovereign, permissioned blockchain network that operates as a Layer-2 solution within the XDC Network ecosystem. It replicates the features of the XDC mainnet, such as its Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism ([XDPoS 2.0](https://github.com/DersonProductions/Crypto-Things/blob/main/XDC/XinFin%20XDPoS%202.0%20Accountability%20and%20Forensics%20in%20Blockchain.md)), while allowing customization for specific enterprise or application needs. The "gasless" feature enables transactions without requiring users to pay gas fees in XDC tokens, as fees can be subsidized by the subnet operator or covered through alternative mechanisms, making it user-friendly for enterprise and consumer applications.[](https://www.xinfin.io/xdc-subnet)

## XDC Network Architecture
The following diagram illustrates the XDC Network’s structure, showing how Master Nodes interact with various blockchain networks (Network 1 and Network 2), each containing public and private chains. This architecture underpins the gasless subnet’s ability to inherit security from the XDC mainnet while operating independently.

##Clients and dApps in the XDC Ecosystem
Clients (end-users or entities) interact with the XDC Network through decentralized applications (dApps), which can be deployed on either the mainnet or a subnet. The mainnet provides a public, secure backbone, while subnets offer customized environments (e.g., gasless transactions, privacy). The diagram below shows how clients, dApps, subnets, and the mainnet interact, including the checkpointing process that ensures subnet security.
